# 🚀 Prompt Optimization and Evaluation Framework

A modular framework designed to **experiment with, optimize, and evaluate AI prompts** by systematically comparing prompt variations and analyzing response quality using structured metrics.

---

## 📌 Overview

Prompt engineering is often done through trial and error. This project aims to bring **structure, evaluation, and repeatability** into the prompt design process.

The **Prompt Optimization and Evaluation Framework** allows developers to:
- Test multiple prompt variations
- Compare AI responses
- Evaluate prompt effectiveness using defined criteria
- Iteratively improve prompts for better consistency and quality

## 🎯 Objectives

- To reduce guesswork in prompt engineering  
- To provide a systematic way to evaluate AI responses  
- To enable prompt versioning and comparison  
- To improve response quality through iterative optimization
